            <br>
            <h2>&emsp; &emsp; I am a recent graduate from The University of Texas at Dallas, where I earned a degree in Information Technology and Systems. Throughout my academic journey, I gained a strong foundation in modern technologies such as Python, JavaScript, and AWS. My experiences, including internships and self-driven projects, have honed my skills in backend development, cloud computing, and web design. I am particularly passionate about AWS and its potential to solve complex, real-world problems, a passion sparked by my work in facial recognition software and API development.

                I thrive in environments that challenge me to stay at the forefront of technological advancements and believe in the power of continuous learning to meet the evolving demands of the industry. I am excited to contribute to innovative projects that drive meaningful, impactful results, and I’m eager to bring my technical expertise and enthusiasm for cloud-based solutions to new opportunities.</h2>

        <h3>Dune Ventures LLC - Backend Mobile Developer – Internship</h3>
        <h3>(June 2023 – December 2023)</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>&emsp;&emsp; During my time at Dune Ventures LLC, I served as a Backend Mobile Developer Intern, where I played a key role in developing and maintaining APIs, managing documentation, and supporting backend services for their mobile application. This hands-on experience allowed me to sharpen my technical skills, particularly in backend development and API integration, while contributing to the overall functionality and user experience of the app.</h4>
        <h4>&emsp;&emsp; One particularly memorable task was building a user verification system using AWS services, where users' licenses were compared to selfies for insurance purposes. Despite having limited prior knowledge of AWS, I invested significant time in research and documentation, creating an AWS architecture diagram and configuring the necessary resources. I utilized API Gateway, Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda to trigger Amazon Rekognition for the machine learning comparison. This project not only fulfilled the security needs of the application but also ignited my passion for AWS, leading me to obtain my Cloud Practitioner certification and pursue further certifications like the Solutions Architect Associate.</h4>

        <h3>(January 2023 – Present)</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>&emsp;&emsp; I embarked on a web design and development project that started as a class assignment and evolved into a personal portfolio. My goal was to create a digital platform to showcase my accomplishments, technical skills, and contact information while simultaneously learning how to code and build a website from scratch. I aimed to design and develop an electronic portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a user-friendly interface while applying modern web development practices. I also wanted to ensure the website was accessible and reliable, so I used AWS Route 53 for hosting. Additionally, I took on the challenge of optimizing the site for mobile devices and enhancing the UI/UX of a related mobile app.</h4>
        <h4>&emsp;&emsp; I built the portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills and contact information, focusing on creating a clean and responsive design. Throughout the project, I actively refined the user experience by analyzing potential issues, troubleshooting design flaws, and making necessary adjustments to enhance functionality. To ensure the site was accessible and reliable, I utilized AWS Route 53 for hosting, guaranteeing high availability for visitors. Additionally, I implemented JavaScript automation to boost visitor engagement and interaction. Beyond the website, I contributed to mobile app UI/UX design, ensuring seamless functionality and a user-friendly interface across different devices.</h4>

        <h3>Group Project, System Analysis and Design</h3>
        <h3>(January 2022 – May 2022)</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>&emsp;&emsp; In our System Analysis and Design group project, we followed the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework and stopped just before the coding phase. Collaborating with a small agile team of four other students, our objective was to simulate the SDLC process while employing agile methodology.</h4>
        <h4>1. Planning<br>
            Objective: Define the scope and purpose of the project.<br>
            Activities: We outlined the project's goals, identified stakeholders, gathered requirements, assigned roles and responsibilities, and created a timeline to guide the process.<br>
            Outcome: This resulted in a clear project roadmap, including timelines and a feasibility study that set the foundation for our project.</h4>
        <h4>2. Requirements Analysis<br>
            Objective: Understand the business needs and define software requirements.<br>
            Activities: Using object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) techniques, we engaged with stakeholders to document both functional and non-functional requirements. We created key diagrams, such as use case diagrams to map user interactions and class diagrams to represent object structure.<br>
            Outcome: This effort culminated in a detailed Requirements Specification Document (RSD) that captured our findings.</h4>
        <h4>3. Design<br>
            Objective: Create a blueprint for the system architecture and user interface.<br>
            Activities: Our team produced a comprehensive design document that included the database schema, high-level and detailed software architecture, user interface wireframes, and considerations for security. We utilized activity and sequence diagrams to visualize system workflows.<br>
            Outcome: The design documents prepared us for the implementation (coding) phase, even though we did not proceed to that stage.</h4>
        <h4>Results:<br>
            Overall, I found this group project immensely helpful in gaining practical experience with the SDLC and preparing a project for implementation. Each phase we followed allowed us to systematically develop a clear and actionable plan for the system. This experience provided valuable insights into real-world systems analysis and design principles, enhancing my skills in project management and collaboration within a team setting.</h4>
